I want you to completely redesign my Roblox marketplace, RoMarket, to be modern, polished, and visually appealing, while keeping it part of the RoModerate ecosystem. Make it feel high-end, smooth, and professional, not generic or AI-looking.

Here’s what I need:

Branding & Logo:

Integrate the RoModerate logo in the top-left, visible on every page.

Use consistent colors, fonts, and style that matches RoModerate’s dashboard.

Marketplace Homepage:

Clean and modern layout for browsing items (cards/grid style).

Include seller’s Discord avatar next to their item listings instead of the default gray icon.

Display item categories, price, seller reputation, and a “Verified Seller” badge clearly.

Include filters for category, price range, trending, newest, etc. in a nice, interactive UI.

Add hover effects on items for quick actions like “Buy” or “View Details.”

Create Listing Page:

Modern form layout with clear sections (Basic Info, Tags, Price, Media Upload).

Add Discord avatar preview for seller at the top.

Use interactive and aesthetic input fields, dropdowns, and buttons.

Include a “preview listing” button so users see how it will look before publishing.

Navigation & UX:

Redesign header to include: Marketplace, Dashboard, Profile, Sell Item.

Keep a sticky navigation bar with clear hierarchy.

Make all buttons, links, and interactive elements consistent and stylish.

Admin/Hidden Panels:

Ensure admin panel works properly and is accessible via the dashboard.

Include tools to manage listings, users, disputes, and reports.

Add a clear design for admin panels that matches the marketplace style.

Consider hidden features for moderation or content approval that are easy to access visually.

Overall Look & Feel:

Modern, smooth gradients or subtle shadows to make the UI pop.

Rounded corners on cards and buttons.

Responsive design for mobile and desktop.

Smooth animations and hover effects for interactive feedback.

Keep it intuitive for users and admins.

Extra Features:

Highlight trending or verified items.

Include real-time stats like active listings, verified sellers, safe/escrow badge.

Add search bar with autocomplete suggestions.

Ensure everything feels like part of the RoModerate ecosystem, not a separate app.

Deliverable: A fully redesigned RoMarket marketplace UI and admin panel, ready for web integration, with clear modern style, Discord avatars integrated, and consistent branding.
